# Custom Block Editor

A custom block editor for WordPress.

The purpose of this project is just to have a deeper understanding of how the
Gutenberg editor works internally.

It was created following the ["Building a custom block
editor"](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/platform/custom-block-editor/tutorial/)
tutorial from the WordPress' [Block Editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/)
handbook.
